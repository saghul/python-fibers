        # This test is designed to crash when active greenlets

        # problem is resolved. How does it work:
        # - order of object creation is important
        # - array is created first, so it is moved to unreachable first
        # - we create a cycle between a greenlet and this array
        # - we create an object that participates in gc, is only
        #   referenced by a greenlet, and would corrupt gc lists
        #   on destruction, the easiest is to use an object with
        #   a finalizer
        # - because array is the first object in unreachable it is
        #   cleared first, which causes all references to greenlet
        #   to disappear and causes greenlet to be destroyed, but since
        #   it is still live it causes a switch during gc, which causes
        #   an object with finalizer to be destroyed, which causes stack
        #   corruption and then a crash
